# A method that returns the sum of two integers

  # Casual:
  # Request number from user
    # Save the first number
  # Request another number from user
    # Save the second number
  # Add the two numbers together
  # Return the sum 

  # Formal:
  # START
  # GET number from user
  # PRINT number
  # GET second number from user
  # PRINT second number
  # SET sum of two numbers
  # PRINT sum of two numbers
  # END

# A method that takes an array of strings and returns a string 
# that is all those strings concatenated together

  # Casual:
  # Given an array of strings
  # Join the strings from the array
  # Print new array

  # Formal:
  # START
    # Given an array of strings called "arr"
  # SET new array
  # PRINT new array
  # END

# A method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array 
# with every other element

  # Casual:
  # Given an array of integers
  # Iterate through the collection one by one 
  #   save the first value as the starting value
  #   for each iteration, skip over every other value
  #   break once the last value is iterated over
  # After iterating through the collection, return the new array

  # Formal:
  # START
  # Given an array of integers called "arr"
  # READ first value, skip over next value
  # PRINT new array
  # END
